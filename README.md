# CO2 Emissions Regression Models

## Overview

This repository contains a simple regression model and a multiple regression model implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. The models are designed to predict CO2 emissions by vehicles based on relevant features from a dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information on CO2 emissions by vehicles, along with various features such as engine size, cylinder, and fuel consumption. The data is utilized to train and evaluate the regression models and predict the CO2 missions based on the data

## Models

### 1. Simple Regression Model

The simple regression model focuses on predicting CO2 emissions based on a single feature. In this case, it explores the relationship between a selected input variable and CO2 emissions.

### 2. Multiple Regression Model

The multiple regression model takes into account multiple features to predict CO2 emissions. This approach provides a more comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing CO2 emissions by vehicles.

## Usage

To use the regression models:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies 
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and test the regression models.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10.9
- scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter notebook (optional)
